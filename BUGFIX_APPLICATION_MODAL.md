# Application Details Modal - Error Fixes

## Issues Found and Fixed

### Problem
The `ApplicationDetailsModal.tsx` component was trying to access properties that didn't exist in the `Application` TypeScript interface, causing compilation errors.

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Updated Application Interface (types.ts)
**File**: `sqlite-demo/services/types.ts`

Added missing fields to the `Application` interface:

```typescript
export interface Application {
  // ... existing fields ...
  
  // Joined fields
  beneficiary_name?: string;
  beneficiary_email?: string;
  beneficiary_phone?: string;
  beneficiary_location?: string;
  reviewed_by_name?: string;
  project_id?: number;              // NEW - ID of project created from this application
  project_title?: string;           // NEW - Title of project created from this application
  project_description?: string;     // NEW - Description of project created from this application
}
```

### 2. Fixed ApplicationDetailsModal.tsx
**File**: `sqlite-demo/components/ApplicationDetailsModal.tsx`

#### Changed:
```typescript
// BEFORE (❌ Error - field doesn't exist)
{application.amount_requested && (
  <Text style={styles.infoValue}>
    ${application.amount_requested.toLocaleString()}
  </Text>
)}

// AFTER (✅ Fixed - using correct field)
{application.target_amount && (
  <Text style={styles.infoValue}>
    ${application.target_amount.toLocaleString()}
  </Text>
)}
```

Changed "Amount Requested" label to "Target Amount" to match the actual field name.

### 3. Backend Already Correct
**File**: `backend/models/applications.js`

All queries already properly return the project information:

```javascript
// ✅ Already includes project fields in queries:
p.id as project_id,
p.title as project_title,
p.description as project_description
```

Queries already updated in these methods:
- `getAll()` ✅
- `getById()` ✅
- `getByBeneficiary()` ✅
- `getByStatus()` ✅

## Summary of Changes

| File | Change | Status |
|------|--------|--------|
| `types.ts` | Added `project_title`, `project_description` fields | ✅ Fixed |
| `ApplicationDetailsModal.tsx` | Changed `amount_requested` → `target_amount` | ✅ Fixed |
| `applications.js` | Already returning correct fields | ✅ Already correct |

## Fields Available in Application Interface

### Application Fields:
- `id`, `beneficiary_id`
- `title`, `description`, `category`
- `application_type`
- `target_amount` ✅ (not `amount_requested`)
- `location`
- `items_requested`, `reason`
- `image_url`, `start_date`, `end_date`
- `voice_recording_url`, `documents`
- `status`, `reviewed_by`, `review_notes`, `reviewed_at`
- `created_at`, `updated_at`

### Joined Fields (from database queries):
- `beneficiary_name`, `beneficiary_email`, `beneficiary_phone`, `beneficiary_location`
- `reviewed_by_name`
- `project_id`, `project_title`, `project_description` ✅ NEW

## Verification

All TypeScript compilation errors have been resolved:
- ✅ No more "Property 'project_title' does not exist" error
- ✅ No more "Property 'project_description' does not exist" error
- ✅ No more "Property 'amount_requested' does not exist" error

The modal now correctly displays:
- Project information (if a project was created from the application)
- Target amount (the correct field from the database)
- All other application details
